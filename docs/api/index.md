# API Overview

This document provides an overview of the API structure for the project.

## Library Structure

Icecap is organized into several layers:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains the core business entities (models), data transfer objects (DTOs), and enumerations (enums) that represent the game's domain concepts.

- **Infrastructure Layer**: Provides the technical capabilities to interact with the game:

- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic.

This layered architecture separates the domain logic from the technical implementation, making the code more maintainable and extensible.
